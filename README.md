Capstone Project for Udacity Android NanoDegree. https://www.udacity.com/course/android-developer-nanodegree--nd801

The app allows business owners to post “Help Wanted” ads, and allows job seekers to view these ads in the app.
Business Owners can post details about their job offering, including name of the business, location, wage rate, picture of the business.
Job seekers can view jobs (based on location), share jobs and send an email to the business owner to express interest in the job.
